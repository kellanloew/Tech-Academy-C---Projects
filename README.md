# Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects

The majority of projects here are drills of various lengths meant to solidfy certain programmign concepts in the C# language. There are some larger, more complex ones though, of particular note:

"ConsoleApp2" is a code-along console app project. It consists of a BlackJack Game in which the player competes against the program. Though this was a code-along, I still had to do lots of troubleshooting to get it to work properyly, and so I learned the key concepts of the C# language and object oriented prgramming in general. 
I learned about namespaces, classes, properties, abstract/static/instance/virtual methods, generics Guids, enums, overriding, overloading, and interfaces.

"InsuranceQuote" is an ASP.NET application that calculates a car insurance quote based on the data that the user enters.  The person's name and insurance details are saved to a SQL Server database, and the admin can later view them from a portal on the website.

The "FinalProject" is the last coding project I did in the C# course. We could choose to focus on one out of a particular set of challenges. I chose to use Knockout.js, so it was mainly focused on the front end. This site was an app that allowed the use to keep track of his or her favorite music.  The user would enter the title, artist/composer, and genre, and when these were added, these details would appear in tabluar form below, with a little button for each title that woul allow the user to delete one or more. Since Knockout.js was new to me, I had to learn how to prioritize the little time I had to work on this project. So I focused on making the front end work, knowing that I could then work on the next step, which would be to edit/delete/save these music titles to a database.

# Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects

"ConsoleApp2" is a code-along console app project. It is a BlackJack Game in which the player plays against the program. In writing this project out, I learned the key concepts of the C# language and object oriented prgramming in general.
I learned about classes, properties, methods, Guids, enums, overriding, overloading, and interfaces.

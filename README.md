# Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects

"ConsoleApp2" is a code-along console app project. It consists of a BlackJack Game in which the player competes against the program. Though this was a code-along, I still had to do lots of troubleshooting to get it to work properyly, and so I learned the key concepts of the C# language and object oriented prgramming in general. 
I learned about namespaces, classes, properties, abstract/static/instance/virtual methods, generics Guids, enums, overriding, overloading, and interfaces.
